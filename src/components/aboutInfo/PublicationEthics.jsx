              Editors have a duty to take action if they suspect misconduct or
              if an allegation of misconduct is notified to them. This duty
              extends to both published and unpublished papers. Editors should
              not merely reject papers that raise concerns over potential
              misconduct. They are ethically obliged to pursue alleged
              cases.Editors should first seek a response from those suspected of
              misconduct. If they are not satisfied with the response, they
              should ask the relevant employers, or institution, or other
              appropriate body to investigate. Editors should make all
              reasonable efforts to ensure that a proper investigation into
              alleged misconduct is conducted; should the latter not take place,
              editors should make all reasonable attempts to obtain a resolution
              to the problem.

            <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold pt-8 pb-2">PLAGIARISM</h1>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Manuscript submissions are checked for intellectual property
              protection and document-versus-document(s) analysis to satisfy the
              Editor that the submitted manuscript has not been plagiarised.
              However, when authors submit their manuscripts for consideration
              in the Journal, they declare that their work is not plagiarised.
              While the Editor makes reasonable efforts to determine the
              academic integrity of papers published in the Journal, ultimate
              responsibility for the originality of submitted manuscripts thus
              lies with the author. Plagiarism takes place when one author
              deliberately uses another’s work without permission, credit, or
              acknowledgment. Authors must always remember that crediting the
              work of others (including your advisor’s or your own previous
              work) is paramount. Authors should always place their work in the
              context of the advancement of the field, and acknowledge the
              findings of others on which you have built your research.
